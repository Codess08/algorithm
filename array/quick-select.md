# Quick Select

Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the k-th smallest/largest element in an unordered list. It uses the `partition` method in Quick Sort. The difference is, instead of recurring for both sides \(after finding pivot\), it recurs only for the part that contains the k-th smallest/largest element.

The time complexity is `O(n)` on average, and O\(N^2\)
