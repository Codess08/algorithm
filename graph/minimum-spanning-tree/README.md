# Minimum Spanning Tree

A minimum-spanning-tree is a tree (without cycles) connecting all the vertices and with the smallest cost.

## Comparison of Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm 

Prim's (`O(ElogV)`) is more performant on dense graph. Kruskal's (`O(ElogE)`) is more performant on sparse graph.
